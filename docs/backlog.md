MiniSupport – Customer Ticketing System (MVP)
User stories (high level)

1. User authentication & roles
    
    As a user, I want to log in with a secure account so that only authorized people can access tickets.

    As an admin, I want to assign roles (customer, agent/admin) so access is controlled.

2. Ticket creation & viewing (CRUD)

    As a customer, I want to create a support ticket with subject, description, and contact details so my issue is recorded.

    As an agent, I want to view a list of tickets and open details for each ticket.

3. Ticket status workflow

    As an agent, I want to change ticket status (Open, In Progress, Resolved) so everyone knows the current state.

    As a customer, I want to see the status of my ticket so I know what is happening.

4. Comments & communication

    As a customer, I want to add comments/replies to my ticket so I can share updates.

    As an agent, I want to respond with comments so communication stays attached to the ticket.

5. Dashboard & filters

    As an agent, I want a simple dashboard with filters (by status, priority, assignee) so I can focus on the most important tickets.

6. Email notifications

    As a customer, I want to receive an email when a ticket is created or resolved so I stay informed without logging in.

7. Reports (later / low priority)

    As a manager, I want to see basic counts of tickets by status and date so I can understand workload and performance.
