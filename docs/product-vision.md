MiniSupport – Customer Ticketing System: Product Vision

MiniSupport is a lightweight, web-based customer support ticketing system designed for small businesses that need a simple, affordable way to track and resolve customer issues. The product gives owners and support staff a single place to see all customer requests, prioritize work, and respond faster without complex enterprise tools.

Business value
1. Centralized, searchable record of all customer issues and conversations.
2. Faster response and resolution times through clear ticket workflow and status.
3. Better customer satisfaction because nothing “falls through the cracks”.
4. Improved internal collaboration between team members working on the same case.
5. Simple setup and minimal training so non-technical users can adopt it quickly.

Target users
1. Small business owners and managers.
2. Support agents or back-office staff handling customer emails, calls, or messages.
3. Occasional users who only need to check ticket status or leave internal notes.

Product vision statement

“MiniSupport enables small businesses to handle every customer request in one place, turning unstructured emails and messages into a clear, trackable workflow that improves response time, visibility, and customer trust.”

“Out of scope for MVP” (no AI, no payments, no mobile app).

“Risks & assumptions” (e.g., single small business, small number of users).
